    Everyone speaks the universal language that is music, and we believe some of the best relationships are formed over just that. A shared interest of an artist, band, album, or even a genre is enough to spark a lifetime connection. There&apos;s no better feeling when music resonates with you, and in turn, resonating with someone you&apos;ve shared it with.
